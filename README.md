### ANN Implementations Steps:

          1. Data Preprocessing
          1.1 Import the Libraries-
          1.2 Load the Dataset
          1.3 Split Dataset into X and Y
          1.4 Encode Categorical Data-
          1.5 Split the X and Y Dataset into the Training set and Test set
          1.6 Perform Feature Scaling

          2. Build Artificial Neural Network
          2.1 Import the Keras libraries and packages
          2.2 Initialize the Artificial Neural Network
          2.3 Add the input layer and the first hidden layer
          2.4 Add the second hidden layer
          2.5 Add the output layer

          3. Train the ANN
          3.1 Compile the ANN
          3.2 Fit the ANN to the Training set

          4. Predict the Test Set Results-
          5. Make the Confusion Matrix
